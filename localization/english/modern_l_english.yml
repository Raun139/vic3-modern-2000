 alpha0_intro.1.d: "Thank you for trying this early prototype of the Modernization Mod.\n\nCurrently Implemented Features:\n- United States only: Population adjusted to match modern estimates\n- United States only: National borders updated to year 2000\n- Construction system restructured (Investment Bureau, construction/maintenance goods, housing demand)\n\n Other countries are not yet updated. Balancing is also not yet done.\n\nThis is the foundation for further development. Feedback or participation is welcome!"
